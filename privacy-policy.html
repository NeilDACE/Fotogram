        listed below this text.
      </p>
      <h3>Data Collection on This Website</h3>
      <h4>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h4>

      </p>
      <h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>

        data is also processed for contract offers, orders, or other service
        requests.
      </p>
      <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>

        certain circumstances, to request the restriction of the processing of
        your personal data. Additionally, you have the right to file a complaint
        with the competent supervisory authority.
      </p>

        data protection.
      </p>
      <h2>2. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
        very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
        accordance with statutory data protection regulations as well as this
        privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal
        data is data that can be used to personally identify you. This privacy
        policy explains which data we collect and what we use it for. It also
        explains how and for what purpose this is done.
      </p>
      <p>
        We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when
        communicating by email) can have security vulnerabilities. Complete
        protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Information on the Responsible Entity</h3>
      <p>The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:</p>
      <p>
        Nil Vollhardt<br />
        Weißbachweg 25<br />
        79312 Emmendingen
      </p>
      <p>
        Phone: +491759226095<br />
        Email: Nil.Vollhardt@gmail.com
      </p>
      <p>
        The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or
        jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing
        personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).
      </p>
      <h3>Data Retention Period</h3>
      <p>
        Unless a more specific retention period is mentioned in this privacy
        policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for
        data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request
        for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be
        deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing
        your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the
        latter case, deletion occurs after these reasons no longer apply.
      </p>
      <h3>
        General Information on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on This
        Website
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal
        data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special
        categories of data according to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the
        case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third
        countries, data processing also takes place based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR.
        If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information
        on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing also
        takes place based on § 25(1) TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time.
        If your data is necessary for contract fulfillment or the implementation
        of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b)
        GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if required to fulfill a legal
        obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based
        on our legitimate interest under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The specific legal
        bases for each case are described in the following sections of this
        privacy policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        In the course of our business, we work with various external entities.
        In some cases, the transfer of personal data to these external entities
        is necessary. We only share personal data with external parties if it is
        required for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so
        (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate
        interest in sharing according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal
        basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only share
        personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for data
        processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing
        agreement is concluded.
      </p>
      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit
        consent. You can revoke already given consent at any time. The legality
        of the data processing carried out up to the revocation remains
        unaffected.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Right to Object in Specific Cases and Against Direct Marketing (Art. 21
        GDPR)
      </h3>
      <p>
        If data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR, you have the
        right at any time to object, for reasons arising from your particular
        situation, to the processing of your personal data; this also applies to
        profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which
        the processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you
        object, we will no longer process your affected personal data unless we
        can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that
        override your interests, rights, and freedoms or if the processing
        serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims
        (objection under Art. 21(1) GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you
        have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data
        concerning you for such advertising; this also applies to profiling
        insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If you object, your
        personal data will no longer be used for direct marketing purposes
        (objection under Art. 21(2) GDPR).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to
        lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the
        member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of
        the alleged infringement. This right to lodge a complaint exists without
        prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
      </p>
      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to receive data that we process automatically based
        on your consent or to fulfill a contract in a commonly used,
        machine-readable format and to transfer it to another controller. If you
        request direct transfer to another controller, this will only be done
        insofar as it is technically feasible.
      </p>
      <h3>Right to Access, Rectification, and Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right, under applicable legal provisions, to obtain free
        information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and
        the purpose of data processing, and, if applicable, the right to correct
        or delete this data. You can contact us at any time regarding this or
        other questions about personal data.
      </p>
      <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data. You can contact us at any time regarding this. The right
        to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul class="privacy-list">
        <li>
          If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we
          usually need time to verify this. During this verification period, you
          have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
          personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may
          request restriction instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise,
          defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request
          restriction instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have lodged an objection under Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of
          your and our interests must be made. As long as it is not yet clear
          whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction
          of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data
        may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise,
        or defense of legal claims, to protect the rights of another natural or
        legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the
        European Union or a member state, except for storage.
